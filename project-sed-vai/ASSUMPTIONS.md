1) The website works optimally in a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080. We have designed it with this resolution in mind as it
    was mentioned in the project specifications.
2) It is assumed that an up-to-date browser is being used for the evaluation which can run HTML5 and CSS3.
3) The website assumes nothing about system text availability and adequate alternatives have been added for different operating systems. However, it was initially created with the Ubuntu font. 
4) The commits to the git repository have been made on the last day since the project was previously being edited in a private Git repository.  
5) Currently, the Top Songs Panel redirects to the album of the respective artist containing that song. 
6) The project is still in a beta stage since many more changes will be made in the other phases.
